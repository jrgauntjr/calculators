## Overview

**Project Title**: Calculators

**Project Description**: A simple erlang program that has many calculators

**Project Goals**: To refresh my knowledge of Erlang

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Chang your directory to the calculators folder
2. Type ```rebar3 shell```

Instructions for using the software:

1. Call the functions this way to use: ```calculators:function(arguments).```
    1. Example ```calculators:calc(1, '+', 1)```  

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio Code
* Erlang 
* WSL or Linux/Unix

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Programing Erlang 2nd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-erlang-2nd/9781941222454/)
* [Erlang offical documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/api-reference.html)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add more tests
* [ ] Add more functions/calculators
* [ ] Give the ability to use cilents and processes
